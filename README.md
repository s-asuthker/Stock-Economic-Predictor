# Stock-Economic-Predictor
It gets real-time stock and economic data (note that sometimes finance won't work and economic data only goes back to like the 1960s). Also some random sci-kit learn and PyTorch stuff in there. I am new to Github so i don't know how anything really works. My code might also have a few issues but I just want to help people incase someone needs this. Also where do I put my code?
